Builds a full site from Markdown content and a shared HTML template. This site documents the generator itself and provides a quick tour of how it works.

## What you can do

- Write content in Markdown
- Reuse a single HTML template
- Copy static assets (CSS, images)
- Generate clean, deployable HTML
